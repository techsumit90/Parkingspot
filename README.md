# Parkingspot
parking Spot Detector
A frontend to display parking spots, possibly using a map or grid layout.

Backend logic to mark spots as 'Free' or 'Occupied'.

You also wanted extra features like:

A "Remove" or "Exit" button when a car leaves.

Dashboard cards showing stats (total spots, available, occupied).

An animated map or interactive background to enhance the UI.
